[[https://travis-ci.org/eps4j/eps4j-core][file:https://travis-ci.org/eps4j/eps4j-core.svg?branch=master]]

eps4j is a Java library that proposes a framework for using Embarrassingly Parallel Search in constraints solvers.
eps4j-core defines the communication architecture.

* Download and Installation

  In the following, we distinguish two usages of eps4j-core:
    - as a standalone application: the jar file includes all required dependencies,
    - as a library: the jar file excludes all dependencies.

** Prerequisites 
  This project works on 32 bits and 64 bits environment. 

  This project requires:

  - Java Virtual Machine 1.8+ 
  - Apache Maven 3.2.3+
  - MPJ Express Project 0.44+
** Inside a maven project

eps4j-core is not (yet) available on Maven Central Repository. 
First, you must build from source and install it into your local .m2 repository.
Then, you only have to edit your pom.xml to declare the following library dependency:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
<dependency>
   <groupId>org.eps4j</groupId>
   <artifactId>eps4j-core</artifactId>
   <version>0.0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

#+END_EXAMPLE

** As a stand-alone application

 The jar file contains all required dependencies. 
 The next step is simply to add the jar file to your classpath of your application. 
 Note that if your program depends on dependencies declared in the jar file, you should consider using eps4j-core as a library.
 
** As a library

 The jar file does not contains any dependencies, as of being used as a dependency of another application. 
 The next step is to add the jar file to your classpath of your application and also add the required dependencies.

** Building from source
 
   This project uses the Cross-platform Maven build system. 
   : mvn clean package 
   or to skip unit tests
   : mvn clean package -DskipTests=true  
   
*** Installing

    Once the project has been built, execute 
  : mvn install
** Dependencies

   The required dependencies for compilation are:
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :exports results
      mvn dependency\:list -DexcludeTransitive=true
    #+END_SRC

    #+RESULTS:
    : org.testng:testng:jar:6.9.10:test

   They are available on Maven Repository (http://mvnrepository.com/).
